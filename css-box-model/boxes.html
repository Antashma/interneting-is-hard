    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However (and this is a big however)</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>
    <!-- <div style="padding-top:1px"> </div>  -->
    <p>Block elements define the flow of the hmtl document, while inline elements do not.</p>

    <div class="">This is a Button that will not do anything. Feel free to press and experience nihilism.</div>
